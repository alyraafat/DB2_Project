# DB2_Project
This is the Project for Databases 2 where we are creating a DataBase Engine from scratch.
In this project, we are building a small database engine with support for Octrees Indices.
The required functionalities are: 
1) creating tables 
2) inserting tuples 
3) deleting tuples 
4) searching in tables linearly
5) creating an Octree upon demand 
6) using the created octree(s) where appropriate(updating, deleting and selecting tuples).
7) Using SQL parser to do the aforementioned actions using SQL statements.
